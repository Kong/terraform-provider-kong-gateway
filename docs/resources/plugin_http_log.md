## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))

### Optional

- `consumer` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `instance_name` (String) A unique string representing a UTF-8 encoded name.
- `ordering` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ordering))
- `partials` (Attributes List) A list of partials to be used by the plugin. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--partials))
- `protocols` (Set of String) A set of strings representing protocols.
- `route` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the route being used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--route))
- `service` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
- `workspace` (String) The name or UUID of the workspace. Default: "default"

### Nested Schema for `config`

Required:

- `http_endpoint` (String) A string representing a URL, such as https://example.com/path/to/resource?q=search.

Optional:

- `content_type` (String) Indicates the type of data sent. The only available option is `application/json`. must be one of ["application/json", "application/json; charset=utf-8"]
- `custom_fields_by_lua` (Map of String) Lua code as a key-value map
- `flush_timeout` (Number) Optional time in seconds. If `queue_size` > 1, this is the max idle time before sending a log with less than `queue_size` records.
- `headers` (Map of String) An optional table of headers included in the HTTP message to the upstream server. Values are indexed by header name, and each header name accepts a single string.
- `keepalive` (Number) An optional value in milliseconds that defines how long an idle connection will live before being closed.
- `method` (String) An optional method used to send data to the HTTP server. Supported values are `POST` (default), `PUT`, and `PATCH`. must be one of ["PATCH", "POST", "PUT"]
- `queue` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--queue))
- `queue_size` (Number) Maximum number of log entries to be sent on each message to the upstream server.
- `retry_count` (Number) Number of times to retry when sending data to the upstream server.
- `timeout` (Number) An optional timeout in milliseconds when sending data to the upstream server.

<a id="nestedatt--config--queue"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.queue`

Optional:

- `concurrency_limit` (Number) The number of of queue delivery timers. -1 indicates unlimited. must be one of ["-1", "1"]

- `max_retry_delay` (Number) Maximum time in seconds between retries, caps exponential backoff.
- `max_retry_time` (Number) Time in seconds before the queue gives up calling a failed handler for a batch.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = kong-gateway_plugin_http_log.my_kong-gateway_plugin_http_log
  id = jsonencode({
    id = "3473c251-5b6c-4f45-b1ff-7ede735a366d"
    workspace = "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import kong-gateway_plugin_http_log.my_kong-gateway_plugin_http_log '{"id": "3473c251-5b6c-4f45-b1ff-7ede735a366d", "workspace": "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"}'
```
