## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = kong-gateway_plugin_session.my_kong-gateway_plugin_session
  id = jsonencode({
    id = "3473c251-5b6c-4f45-b1ff-7ede735a366d"
    workspace = "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import kong-gateway_plugin_session.my_kong-gateway_plugin_session '{"id": "3473c251-5b6c-4f45-b1ff-7ede735a366d", "workspace": "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"}'
```
