## Schema

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `consumer` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `consumer_group` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer_group))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `instance_name` (String)
- `ordering` (String) Parsed as JSON.
- `protocols` (List of String) A list of the request protocols that will trigger this plugin. The default value, as well as the possible values allowed on this field, may change depending on the plugin type. For example, plugins that only work in stream mode will only support `"tcp"` and `"tls"`.
- `route` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Route being used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--route))
- `service` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin for grouping and filtering.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

Optional:

- `custom_fields_by_lua` (Map of String) A list of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of a log field and the value is a chunk of Lua code, whose return value sets or replaces the log field value.
- `host` (String) The IP address or host name to send data to.
- `keepalive` (Number) An optional value in milliseconds that defines how long an idle connection lives before being closed.
- `port` (Number) The port to send data to on the upstream server.
- `timeout` (Number) An optional timeout in milliseconds when sending data to the upstream server.
- `tls` (Boolean) Indicates whether to perform a TLS handshake against the remote server.
- `tls_sni` (String) An optional string that defines the SNI (Server Name Indication) hostname to send in the TLS handshake.
