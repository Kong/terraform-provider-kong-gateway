## Schema

### Required

- `cert` (String) PEM-encoded public certificate of the CA.

### Optional

- `cert_digest` (String) SHA256 hex digest of the public certificate. This field is read-only and it cannot be set by the caller, the value is automatically computed.
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Certificate for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = kong-gateway_ca_certificate.my_kong-gateway_ca_certificate
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import kong-gateway_ca_certificate.my_kong-gateway_ca_certificate "..."
```
