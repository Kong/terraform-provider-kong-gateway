      A CA certificate object represents a trusted certificate authority.
      These objects are used by Kong Gateway to verify the validity of a client or server certificate.
    name: CA Certificates

      A certificate object represents a public certificate, and can be optionally paired with the corresponding private key. These objects are used by Kong Gateway to handle SSL/TLS termination for encrypted requests, or for use as a trusted CA store when validating peer certificate of client/service.
      <br><br>
      Certificates are optionally associated with SNI objects to tie a cert/key pair to one or more hostnames.
      <br><br>
      If intermediate certificates are required in addition to the main certificate, they should be concatenated together into one string.

      Consumer groups enable the organization and categorization of consumers (users or applications) within an API ecosystem.

  - description: |
      The consumer object represents a consumer - or a user - of a service.

  - description: 'Some entities in Kong Gateway share common configuration settings that often need to be repeated. For example, multiple plugins that connect to Redis may require the same connection settings. Without Partials, you would need to replicate this configuration across all plugins. If the settings change, you would need to update each plugin individually.'
    name: Partials
  - description: |-
      A plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during the HTTP request/response lifecycle. Plugins let you add functionality to services that run behind a Kong Gateway instance, like authentication or rate limiting.
      You can find more information about available plugins and which values each plugin accepts at the [Plugin Hub](https://developer.konghq.com/plugins/).
      <br><br>
      When adding a plugin configuration to a service, the plugin will run on every request made by a client to that service. If a plugin needs to be tuned to different values for some specific consumers, you can do so by creating a separate plugin instance that specifies both the service and the consumer, through the service and consumer fields.

      Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each route is associated with a service, and a service may have multiple routes associated to it. Every request matching a given route will be proxied to the associated service. You need at least one matching rule that applies to the protocol being matched by the route.
      <br><br>
      The combination of routes and services, and the separation of concerns between them, offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is possible to define fine-grained entrypoints in Kong Gateway leading to different upstream services of your infrastructure.
      <br><br>
      Depending on the protocol, one of the following attributes must be set:
      <br>

      - `http`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`
      - `https`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`
      - `tcp`: At least one of `sources` or `destinations`
      - `tls`: at least one of `sources`, `destinations`, or `snis`
      - `tls_passthrough`: set `snis`
      - `grpc`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`
      - `grpcs`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`
      - `ws`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`
      - `wss`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`
        <br>
        A route can't have both `tls` and `tls_passthrough` protocols at same time.

      An SNI object represents a many-to-one mapping of hostnames to a certificate.
      <br><br>
      A certificate object can have many hostnames associated with it. When Kong Gateway receives an SSL request, it uses the SNI field in the Client Hello to look up the certificate object based on the SNI associated with the certificate.

      Service entities are abstractions of your microservice interfaces or formal APIs. For example, a service could be a data transformation microservice or a billing API.
      <br><br>
      The main attribute of a service is the destination URL for proxying traffic. This URL can be set as a single string or by specifying its protocol, host, port and path individually.
      <br><br>
      Services are associated to routes, and a single service can have many routes associated with it. Routes are entrypoints in Kong Gateway which define rules to match client requests. Once a route is matched, Kong Gateway proxies the request to its associated service. See the [Route documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/entities/route/) for a detailed explanation of how Kong proxies traffic.
      <br><br>
      Services can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](https://developer.konghq.com/admin-api/).

      A target is an IP address or hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be dynamically added, modified, or deleted. Changes take effect on the fly.
      <br><br>
      To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`, or use the `DELETE` method to accomplish the same.
    name: Targets
  - description: |-
      The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to load balance incoming requests over multiple services (targets).
      <br><br>
      An upstream also includes a [health checker](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/traffic-control/health-checks-circuit-breakers/), which can enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve requests.
      The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream object, and applies to all of its targets.

      Vault objects are used to configure different vault connectors for [managing secrets](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/secrets-management/).
      Configuring a vault lets you reference secrets from other entities.
      This allows for a proper separation of secrets and configuration and prevents secret sprawl.
      <br><br>
      For example, you could store a certificate and a key in a vault, then reference them from a certificate entity. This way, the certificate and key are not stored in the entity directly and are more secure.
      <br><br>
      Secrets rotation can be managed using [TTLs](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/entities/vault/).
