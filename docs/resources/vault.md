## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Vault that's going to be added. Currently, the Vault implementation must be installed in every Kong instance.
- `prefix` (String) The unique prefix (or identifier) for this Vault configuration. The prefix is used to load the right Vault configuration and implementation when referencing secrets with the other entities.

### Optional

- `config` (String) The configuration properties for the Vault which can be found on the vaults' documentation page. Parsed as JSON.
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `description` (String) The description of the Vault entity.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Vault for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
- `workspace` (String) The name or UUID of the workspace. Default: "default"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = kong-gateway_vault.my_kong-gateway_vault
  id = jsonencode({
    id = "9d4d6d19-77c6-428e-a965-9bc9647633e9"
    workspace = "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import kong-gateway_vault.my_kong-gateway_vault '{"id": "9d4d6d19-77c6-428e-a965-9bc9647633e9", "workspace": "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"}'
```
