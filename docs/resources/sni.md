## Schema

### Optional

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the SNIs for grouping and filtering.

### Nested Schema for `certificate`

Optional:

- `id` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = kong-gateway_sni.my_kong-gateway_sni
  id = jsonencode({
    id = "64c17a1a-b7d7-4a65-a5a4-42e4a7016e7f"
    workspace = "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import kong-gateway_sni.my_kong-gateway_sni '{"id": "64c17a1a-b7d7-4a65-a5a4-42e4a7016e7f", "workspace": "747d1e5-8246-4f65-a939-b392f1ee17f8"}'
```
