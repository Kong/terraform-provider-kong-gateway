## Schema

### Optional

- `redis_ce` (Attributes) Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--redis_ce))
- `redis_ee` (Attributes) Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--redis_ee))
- `workspace` (String) The name or UUID of the workspace. Default: "default"; Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `name` (String) A unique string representing a UTF-8 encoded name.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

<a id="nestedatt--redis_ce"></a>
### Nested Schema for `redis_ce`

Optional:

- `config` (Attributes) Not Null; Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--redis_ce--config))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created. Requires replacement if changed.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier). Requires replacement if changed.
- `name` (String) A unique string representing a UTF-8 encoded name. Requires replacement if changed.
- `tags` (List of String) A set of strings representing tags. Requires replacement if changed.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated. Requires replacement if changed.

<a id="nestedatt--redis_ce--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `redis_ce.config`

Optional:

- `database` (Number) Database to use for the Redis connection when using the `redis` strategy. Requires replacement if changed.
- `host` (String) A string representing a host name, such as example.com. Requires replacement if changed.
- `password` (String) Password to use for Redis connections. If undefined, no AUTH commands are sent to Redis. Requires replacement if changed.
- `port` (Number) An integer representing a port number between 0 and 65535, inclusive. Requires replacement if changed.
- `server_name` (String) A string representing an SNI (server name indication) value for TLS. Requires replacement if changed.
- `ssl` (Boolean) If set to true, uses SSL to connect to Redis. Requires replacement if changed.
- `ssl_verify` (Boolean) If set to true, verifies the validity of the server SSL certificate. If setting this parameter, also configure `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` in `kong.conf` to specify the CA (or server) certificate used by your Redis server. You may also need to configure `lua_ssl_verify_depth` accordingly. Requires replacement if changed.
- `timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2. Requires replacement if changed.
- `username` (String) Username to use for Redis connections. If undefined, ACL authentication won't be performed. This requires Redis v6.0.0+. To be compatible with Redis v5.x.y, you can set it to `default`. Requires replacement if changed.



<a id="nestedatt--redis_ee"></a>
### Nested Schema for `redis_ee`

Optional:

- `config` (Attributes) Not Null; Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--redis_ee--config))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created. Requires replacement if changed.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier). Requires replacement if changed.
- `name` (String) A unique string representing a UTF-8 encoded name. Requires replacement if changed.
- `tags` (List of String) A set of strings representing tags. Requires replacement if changed.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated. Requires replacement if changed.

<a id="nestedatt--redis_ee--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `redis_ee.config`

Optional:

- `cluster_max_redirections` (Number) Maximum retry attempts for redirection. Requires replacement if changed.
- `cluster_nodes` (Attributes List) Cluster addresses to use for Redis connections when the `redis` strategy is defined. Defining this field implies using a Redis Cluster. The minimum length of the array is 1 element. Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--redis_ee--config--cluster_nodes))
- `connect_timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2. Requires replacement if changed.
- `connection_is_proxied` (Boolean) If the connection to Redis is proxied (e.g. Envoy), set it `true`. Set the `host` and `port` to point to the proxy address. Requires replacement if changed.
- `database` (Number) Database to use for the Redis connection when using the `redis` strategy. Requires replacement if changed.
- `host` (String) A string representing a host name, such as example.com. Requires replacement if changed.
- `keepalive_backlog` (Number) Limits the total number of opened connections for a pool. If the connection pool is full, connection queues above the limit go into the backlog queue. If the backlog queue is full, subsequent connect operations fail and return `nil`. Queued operations (subject to set timeouts) resume once the number of connections in the pool is less than `keepalive_pool_size`. If latency is high or throughput is low, try increasing this value. Empirically, this value is larger than `keepalive_pool_size`. Requires replacement if changed.
- `keepalive_pool_size` (Number) The size limit for every cosocket connection pool associated with every remote server, per worker process. If neither `keepalive_pool_size` nor `keepalive_backlog` is specified, no pool is created. If `keepalive_pool_size` isn't specified but `keepalive_backlog` is specified, then the pool uses the default value. Try to increase (e.g. 512) this value if latency is high or throughput is low. Requires replacement if changed.
- `password` (String) Password to use for Redis connections. If undefined, no AUTH commands are sent to Redis. Requires replacement if changed.
- `port` (Number) An integer representing a port number between 0 and 65535, inclusive. Requires replacement if changed.
- `read_timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2. Requires replacement if changed.
- `send_timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2. Requires replacement if changed.
- `sentinel_master` (String) Sentinel master to use for Redis connections. Defining this value implies using Redis Sentinel. Requires replacement if changed.
- `sentinel_nodes` (Attributes List) Sentinel node addresses to use for Redis connections when the `redis` strategy is defined. Defining this field implies using a Redis Sentinel. The minimum length of the array is 1 element. Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--redis_ee--config--sentinel_nodes))
- `sentinel_password` (String) Sentinel password to authenticate with a Redis Sentinel instance. If undefined, no AUTH commands are sent to Redis Sentinels. Requires replacement if changed.
- `sentinel_role` (String) Sentinel role to use for Redis connections when the `redis` strategy is defined. Defining this value implies using Redis Sentinel. must be one of ["any", "master", "slave"]; Requires replacement if changed.
- `sentinel_username` (String) Sentinel username to authenticate with a Redis Sentinel instance. If undefined, ACL authentication won't be performed. This requires Redis v6.2.0+. Requires replacement if changed.
- `server_name` (String) A string representing an SNI (server name indication) value for TLS. Requires replacement if changed.
- `ssl` (Boolean) If set to true, uses SSL to connect to Redis. Requires replacement if changed.
- `ssl_verify` (Boolean) If set to true, verifies the validity of the server SSL certificate. If setting this parameter, also configure `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` in `kong.conf` to specify the CA (or server) certificate used by your Redis server. You may also need to configure `lua_ssl_verify_depth` accordingly. Requires replacement if changed.
- `username` (String) Username to use for Redis connections. If undefined, ACL authentication won't be performed. This requires Redis v6.0.0+. To be compatible with Redis v5.x.y, you can set it to `default`. Requires replacement if changed.
