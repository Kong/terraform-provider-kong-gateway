## Schema

### Required

- `upstream_id` (String) ID or target of the Target to lookup

### Optional

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Target for grouping and filtering.
- `target` (String) The target address (ip or hostname) and port. If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, the `port` value will be overridden by the value from the DNS record.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
- `upstream` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--upstream))
- `weight` (Number) The weight this target gets within the upstream loadbalancer (`0`-`65535`). If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, the `weight` value will be overridden by the value from the DNS record.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--upstream"></a>
### Nested Schema for `upstream`

Optional:

- `id` (String)
