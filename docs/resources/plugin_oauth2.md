## Schema

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `consumer` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `consumer_group` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer_group))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `instance_name` (String)
- `ordering` (String) Parsed as JSON.
- `protocols` (List of String) A list of the request protocols that will trigger this plugin. The default value, as well as the possible values allowed on this field, may change depending on the plugin type. For example, plugins that only work in stream mode will only support `"tcp"` and `"tls"`.
- `route` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Route being used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--route))
- `service` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin for grouping and filtering.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `accept_http_if_already_terminated` (Boolean) Accepts HTTPs requests that have already been terminated by a proxy or load balancer.
- `anonymous` (String) An optional string (consumer UUID or username) value to use as an “anonymous” consumer if authentication fails.
- `auth_header_name` (String) The name of the header that is supposed to carry the access token.
- `enable_authorization_code` (Boolean) An optional boolean value to enable the three-legged Authorization Code flow (RFC 6742 Section 4.1).
- `enable_client_credentials` (Boolean) An optional boolean value to enable the Client Credentials Grant flow (RFC 6742 Section 4.4).
- `enable_implicit_grant` (Boolean) An optional boolean value to enable the Implicit Grant flow which allows to provision a token as a result of the authorization process (RFC 6742 Section 4.2).

- `global_credentials` (Boolean) An optional boolean value that allows using the same OAuth credentials generated by the plugin with any other service whose OAuth 2.0 plugin configuration also has `config.global_credentials=true`.

- `mandatory_scope` (Boolean) An optional boolean value telling the plugin to require at least one `scope` to be authorized by the end user.
