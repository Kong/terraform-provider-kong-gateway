## Schema

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `consumer` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `instance_name` (String)
- `ordering` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ordering))
- `partials` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--partials))
- `protocols` (List of String) A list of the request protocols that will trigger this plugin. The default value, as well as the possible values allowed on this field, may change depending on the plugin type. For example, plugins that only work in stream mode will only support tcp and tls.
- `route` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the route being used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--route))
- `service` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `authentication` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--authentication))
- `bootstrap_servers` (Attributes List) Set of bootstrap brokers in a `{host: host, port: port}` list format. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--bootstrap_servers))
- `cluster_name` (String) An identifier for the Kafka cluster. By default, this field generates a random string. You can also set your own custom cluster identifier.  If more than one Kafka plugin is configured without a `cluster_name` (that is, if the default autogenerated value is removed), these plugins will use the same producer, and by extension, the same cluster. Logs will be sent to the leader of the cluster.
- `custom_fields_by_lua` (Map of String) Lua code as a key-value map
- `keepalive` (Number)
- `keepalive_enabled` (Boolean)
- `producer_async` (Boolean) Flag to enable asynchronous mode.
- `producer_async_buffering_limits_messages_in_memory` (Number) Maximum number of messages that can be buffered in memory in asynchronous mode.
- `producer_async_flush_timeout` (Number) Maximum time interval in milliseconds between buffer flushes in asynchronous mode.
- `producer_request_acks` (Number) The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. Allowed values: 0 for no acknowledgments; 1 for only the leader; and -1 for the full ISR (In-Sync Replica set). must be one of ["-1", "0", "1"]
- `producer_request_limits_bytes_per_request` (Number) Maximum size of a Produce request in bytes.
- `producer_request_limits_messages_per_request` (Number) Maximum number of messages to include into a single Produce request.
- `producer_request_retries_backoff_timeout` (Number) Backoff interval between retry attempts in milliseconds.
- `producer_request_retries_max_attempts` (Number) Maximum number of retry attempts per single Produce request.
- `producer_request_timeout` (Number) Time to wait for a Produce response in milliseconds
- `security` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--security))
- `timeout` (Number) Socket timeout in milliseconds.
- `topic` (String) The Kafka topic to publish to.

<a id="nestedatt--config--authentication"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.authentication`

Optional:

- `mechanism` (String) The SASL authentication mechanism.  Supported options: `PLAIN` or `SCRAM-SHA-256`. must be one of ["PLAIN", "SCRAM-SHA-256", "SCRAM-SHA-512"]
- `password` (String) Password for SASL authentication.
- `strategy` (String) The authentication strategy for the plugin, the only option for the value is `sasl`. must be "sasl"
- `tokenauth` (Boolean) Enable this to indicate `DelegationToken` authentication
- `user` (String) Username for SASL authentication.


<a id="nestedatt--config--bootstrap_servers"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.bootstrap_servers`

Optional:

- `host` (String) A string representing a host name, such as example.com. Not Null
